A lot of work has happened in Sigma which is relevant to this unit, some of
which we may consider back porting to improve capabilities.

1) Operating on less that a full spectrum.   In the sigma code it was meant
to be embedded in a controller which was memory limited.  To deal with this
rather than holding the full spectrum in the accumulator instead it holds
small regions where the peak is expected to be.  So long as the peak is
in the range then it can fit.  

Structurally this is just defining a region for the peak tracker to operate on.
The peak fitters don't need to know anything about the spectrum other than the
data type thus even if the spectrum only represents a fraction of the energy
channel range all is good.

2) Adjusting the accumulation coefficients based on the count rate in a region.
Nominally we tune the tracking rate to give the desired noise behavior and 
stability on a typically data file.   If the count rate goes up the accuracy 
improves, but if the count rate falls we tend to get worse performance.  We
could get the same performance if we adjust the accumulator coefficients based
the the count rate.  

Structurally this is a simple change to the PredictivePeakTracker.   It is has
a region and an expected count rate, it can use a formula to compute the best
coefficients for the conditions.   This will increase the lockon time for low
rates (Florida) but otherwise will not cause any issues.

3) High voltage adjustments.   We are working with more systems that are HV
controlled.   Out predictive peak tracker is mainly designed to operate on data
in which the detector is unlocked.   When working with a locked system, we need
to consider the effects of those shifts on the tracker.
